Tasks concerning a machine learning classification problem in data science.
The tasks presented below will aid you to work through a binary classification problem using R
programming. These tasks concern the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset found in the “mlbench” Rpackage. Each record in the dataset represents one breast cancer tissue sample. The data was collected
from University of Wisconsin Hospitals. Below is a summary of the attributes:

- Sample code number id number.
- Clump Thickness.
- Uniformity of Cell Size.
- Uniformity of Cell Shape.
- Marginal Adhesion.
- Single Epithelial Cell Size.
- Bare Nuclei.
- Bland Chromatin.
- Normal Nucleoli.
- Mitoses.
- Class.
